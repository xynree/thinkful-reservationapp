# Thinkful Capstone: Restaurant Reservation System

A full stack web application created as the final capstone for Thinkful's Full Stack Engineering Flex bootcamp program. This project connects to a database to implement the CRUD API for setting up reservations. View the deployed project [here](thinkful-reservationapp.vercel.app).

## Usage
```bash
npm i
npm start
```
Servers will start on `localhost:3000` and `localhost:5000` for the client and server respectively.

## Technologies Used
Frontend is built in React with React Router v5. Uses Bootstrap for styling.     
Backend uses Node.js with Express using Knex in PostgreSQL.  
E2E Tests are written in Jest with Puppeteer.

## Credits
